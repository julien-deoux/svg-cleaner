# svg-cleaner

Small Python tool which converts an SVG file into its most barebones version, for use within HTML code:
* Removes useless information from SVG editors such as Inkscape or Illustrator.
* Removes invisible layers and paths.

## TODO

Create an Angular mode which removes flowRoot elements.
